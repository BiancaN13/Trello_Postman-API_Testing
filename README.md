# Trello-API Testing
This project contains a Postman collection for testing the Trello API. The collection includes several requests for interacting with the Trello API, such as retrieving information about all boards, creating a new board, creating lists and cards, and deleting a board.
## Introduction
The Trello API enables the creation of applications that can interact with Trello's project management service, such as managing boards, lists, and cards, or retrieving user data.

The Trello API provides a wide range of functionality for developers, including:

-Retrieve data from your boards, lists, or cards.
-Search for specific Trello boards or cards.
-Create and manage your boards, lists, and cards: create new boards, add lists, move cards, and more.
-Automate task management by moving cards between lists or archiving completed tasks.
-Get real-time updates on changes to your boards, lists, or cards.
-And much more! You can find a complete list of available endpoints in the API Reference.
